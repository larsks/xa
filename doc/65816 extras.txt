All 65816 addressing modes have been added to XA, including:
(Direct page is the same as zero page, apart from the fact that Zero 
page can be moved on 65816)

Long				LDA long

Direct page indirect		LDA (dp)

Direct Page indirect Long	LDA [dp]

Absolute long indexed,Y		LDA long,x

DP indirect long indexed,Y	LDA [dp],y

Stack relative			LDA sr,S

SR Indirect Indexed,Y		lda (sr,S),Y

The MVN and MVP opcodes do however not use the syntax: MVN src,dest 
but instead just use: MVN absolute, so for example MVN $10,$00 would 
be MVN $0010.

The psuedo ops .as, .al, .xs & .xl are used to decide what size 
accumulator and index mode for the assembler to use. .as and .xs are 
for 8bit operands, and .al and .xl are for 16 bit operands.

In addition to the new modes, the symbols ! and @ can be used to force 
16bit and 24bit addressing respectively. So:

LDA @$ff00
would be a long address rather than an absolute address.

and:

STA !$f0 
would be a 16bit address rather than Direct Page.

use -W on the command line to force no 65816 opcodes.
