                      65816 cross assembler xa65

The new version of the 6502 crossassembler now supports 

                          65816 opcodes!

The assembler is under GNU public license and can be found at:

General description:

- C-like Preprocessor to make macros 
- label "hiding" on different levels,
  i.e. multiple use of the same label possible 
- 1.5-pass assembler:
  Everything that can be derefenced is being assembled in pass 1 and
  saved in memory. The second pass does the rest. This (together
  with hashing etc) gives quite a good speed (30kByte binary out of
  300kByte source in less than two minutes on an 8MHz Atari ST -
  hey, the first versions would have taken half an hour for this
  job! - my 486DX4/100 with linux needs around two seconds or so...)
- needs no linker - all stuff is in source code (with this speed,
  it's ok) 
- (optional) support for relocatable 'o65' file format,
  including linker, relocator and file utility.  A loader in 6502
  assembly code is also included. 65816 is not yet supported here, though.
- reads DOS and Unix(tm) files (LF or CR+LF)

so long
